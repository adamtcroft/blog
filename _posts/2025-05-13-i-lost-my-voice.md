...and I don't mean writer's block. I mean full-on identity self re-evaluation. 
Not in the mid-life crisis sense, the "lost my purpose" sense (okay, maybe a 
_smidge_), or the "I need therapy" sense (but some of that has happened for 
other reasons).

I mean that over the course of almost 10 years, I forgot how to speak in the 
modern sense of how we now talk: on the internet. It's been a little weird, 
because at one point I was open enough to amass a small following in a little 
corner that affected people (both positively and negatively). Then a thing I 
did... vanished.

I've signed up for social media accounts, and I've posted on them occasionally. 
But, each time I try, I wind up with a different variation of the exact same 
theme: _why am I doing this?_, _what's the point?_, _I have nothing useful to 
say here_, _the more I log onto this, the worse I feel_.

None of that is unique to me. I'm not a special case. Lots of people dislike 
the modern internet, and essentialy everyone acknowledges to being casually 
addicted to it and its anger-despair inducing pull.

But I juxtapose my ever-growing extreme disinterest in the medium by which we 
exchange ideas, thoughts, and conversation - with my internal true desire to 
share.

I haven't known how to do it in a way that feels "right" for __years__. I still 
don't - and this is another effort to try and play (which, I also didn't expect 
to write about).

# So why here?
Along with my disinterest in social (inclusive of stuff like Twitch and YouTube, 
too), has come an ever-increasing interest in I guess what you'd call "retro" 
computing. It doesn't feel "retro" to me, maybe "throwback" is a better term. 
But, I'm writing this on a command line terminal because I can, and because it's 
fun, and because WordPress drives me nuts.

I'm putting it up on Github because it's fun, because it's a place to more 
easily connect with developers, and because it's easy to share on the social 
sites I may want to engage. It's also fun to keep a repository instead of a 
blog. It's a little off-beat and enjoyable.

I think you can see, the through-line here is "fun".

# Why a blog?  Who reads blogs anymore?
Well, let me say _meh_ again to social - but let me also say that I've realized 
I personally can't handle social. I've forgotten how to post/talk/think/share 
in short bursts. I've written two books in a few years, and I trained myself to 
write thoughts completely again, and even to draft them out in bullets first 
(what you're reading is a stream-of-consciousness exercise, though).

Worst of all, social media begs me to do a modern sin - _scroll_. There's no 
term for joyfully, happily, enjoying scrolling, there's only __doomscroll__. No 
matter how I tune an algorithm, timeline, or whatever, I always lose. I have a 
0% success rate. It's not due to the app, either!  Some of them are actually 
amazing and easily tuneable such that I can get a pretty good feed going for a 
while. But, inevitably, I see something I get envious of, or I click on 
    something I really shouldn't, or I add someone and they start changing what 
    they post. Then I begin to repeat the theme:

_Why am I doing this again?_

So, I want to share long(er) form. You don't have to read it. By all means, 
__don't__ read it, please. It's less pressure on me to deliver something worth 
reading! Regardless of your interest or intentions, if I can "grease the 
groove" so to speak and get the words flowing regularly again - I'll be here.

And with that... I think this is good enough for now.
