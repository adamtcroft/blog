Here’s your game audio 2025 “best chances to get involved with AAA companies” cheat code (in order):

# Make Friends and "Network"
Talk to people in person and/or online. DMs if you’re not local to a game dev hub city (Seattle, LA, Vancouver, Montreal, etc), meetups if you are.

# Learn Audiokinetic Wwise
If you don’t know Wwise, it’s like not knowing a DAW in AAA gaming. There are other options like MetaSounds and FMOD, but Wwise still owns the majority of the AAA market.

# Make a terrible Unreal 5 demo game
Yes, complete a full “make a craptastic game in Unreal 5" tutorial on YouTube. Make a simple game, make it bad, make it for you. Learn other parts of game development a little bit. And every AAA is asking for Unreal 5/Blueprints experience right now, so it's worth learning.

# Keep your pracitce up
If you’re not employed or have a day job, make redesigns you find fun and enjoyable. No more than 3-5 seconds (ie: redesign a spell or a gunshot) and not a whole scene. Post them to LinkedIn. If you’re not having fun with it and it’s not making you laugh or get pumped, you’re doing it wrong. If you're a programmer, do programmer-y things (ie: build stuff) have fun, and show it off, too.
