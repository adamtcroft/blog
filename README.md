## Hey friends,
My name's Adam, but everyone at Bungie calls me "Croft" because there's too many 
of us Adams around.  I spend most of my professional time playing a support role 
in the Audio department in the effort to innovate and streamline content 
workflows, as well as firefight impossible problems where necessary.

This typically looks like concepting and developing workflows, programming 
tools, and leading a small team.  Occasionally this means confronting massive 
bugs, or watching tools updates bork an entire development branch, and figuring 
out how to solve those problems _very_ quickly.

Prior to working at Bungie, I spent time at Xbox, 343 Industries, and PopCap 
Games.  Before games, I worked as an Audiovisual Designer drafting technology 
systems in AutoCAD for various architects.  In ancient times, I worked as a 
freelance audio engineer in live audio, TV, films, corporate events, and more.

Essentially, if it makes sound, I've probably been fortunate enough to be a part 
of doing it.

When I was yet a babe, I earned a B.A. in Theatrical Arts from Roanoke College 
(with a graduating class of 3), a 900-hour Recording Arts certificate from the 
Los Angeles Recording School, a certificate in C++ programming from the 
University of Washington, and I'm supposedly still part of Alpha Psi Omega 
(National Theatre Honor Fraternity).

I've also authored a few books on breaking into a game audio career, built a few 
online courses, and overall I'm pretty fortunate to have done some wildly cool 
things.  All said, if it makes noise, it's interactive, programmatic, or an 
impossible problem - it's probably my thing.

Outside of work and computers - you're most likely to catch me on the lake 
paddling a kayak (assuming the weather is good), or trying not to get choked out 
in Jiu Jitsu.
