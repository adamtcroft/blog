# How to lose your job, not your soul
I think to say it's been a hard few years for game developers is probably an 
understatement.

If you haven't been laid off, experienced a studio closure, or found it 
impossible to land a new gig... you probably know someone who has.  _Everyone_ 
has just been doing their best to cope emotionally.  I write this from the 
position of a fully employed lead, and even I've found my emotional wits end 
over the last two years (no need to feel bad for me, I'm being paid to carry 
burdens).

In this place, what's weighed heavy on my heart is something I've tried to 
communicate to a lot of my current and former colleagues.  I'm also, frankly, a 
little terrified to share online because I'm hyper-aware not everyone shares the 
same opinions, perspectives, and emotions as me... but... well... I've gone 
through a large number of rough times myself and I just want to help who I can.

So, my thesis here is it's possible to lose your job and still land on your feet 
despite the hardship.  It's possible not only to keep your soul, but through a 
metaphorical dry valley, come to know and trust yourself even more while landing 
in a better place than ever.

Will it be easy?  Probably not.  Worth it and doable anyway?  Every time I've 
gone through it, yes.

So especially for my younger colleagues who are experiencing mess like this for 
the first time, hopefully this helps and encourages you.





This is to my younger game dev colleagues


Main idea: for work, you must trust in yourself

## What do you mean, trust in yourself?
- If you made it, and you got laid off, you already made it once.  I've told 
  many a colleague this over time: we don't hire people who suck.
- Tragedy befalls everyone.  Even if you were in a "more stable" field - nobody 
  holds the same job for 25-30 years like my father in-law did anymore.  Sure, 
  quitting for a better opportunity is "better" - but it's still a stressful and 
  anxiety-ridden affair.
- If you make it into game dev, the majority of us have a significant amount of 
  cross-discipline skill sets.  Maybe you don't _stay_ in game dev (this is game 
  dev's problem, not yours), but you probably have a diverse set of skills and 
  interests such that you're capable of picking up another (possibly even MORE 
  rad) gig.
- Difficult truth: nobody knows what the "right choice" is for you, in difficult 
  times or not, other than you.  Companies aren't trustworthy to the individual, 
  that's not their role.  You _must_ become trustworthy to yourself.
- Strength, capability, and endurance are forged through difficult times, not 
  easy times.  Heroes don't go on a "training arc" because they're facing a 
  battle they can win in their sleep, they train because they know what's coming 
  is _hard_.

## Why is trusting in yourself important?
- If you can't trust in yourself, who can you trust?
- Companies aren't trustworthy and reliable to you

## But shouldn't others be accountable?
- Terrible and deviant behavior should be held accountable.  I don't have an 
  interest here in prescribing "how".  This gets into a much larger "by whose 
  standards should companies and leaders be held accountable to?" conversation 
  and problem.  I am not going to stake a claim here.
- If you see or feel something wrong, my encouragement is to communicate and 
  attempt to work it out while holding others in good faith.
- IMO, yes, evil exists.  Yes, people who make short-sighted, terrible, selfish 
  decisions exist.  Also plenty of people go to work with the desire to do good, 
  think they're doing good, and still result in terrible, selfish, short-sighted 
  decisions
- You're never going to _go wrong_ attempting change and reconciliation in good 
  faith.  Sometimes, you can't get the results you wish to achieve regardless.

## How does trusting in myself work, practically?
- Bring your best self to what you do, every day.  Your best self may only be 
  10% one day, that's okay.  Just bring it, and do it for _you_.
- If you have a job, and you're struggling with your role or the company, don't 
  wait on others to resolve the issues for you.  Communicate in good faith, and 
  discern your wants/needs, then aim to resolve them.  Find a new role with a 
  new company if you need, try and move to a new role or manager or whatever 
  else you may need.  If you are truly stuck (ie: you've done everything you can 
  and you've got no movement), give yourself grace and be patient.
- Don't wait to create or update your resume until you need it
- Don't hide out in the shadows hoping everyone has you top-of-mind has any idea 
  you're looking for work
- Remember what you've done to get where you are.  Honor that.  Remember that 
  you're a badass.
