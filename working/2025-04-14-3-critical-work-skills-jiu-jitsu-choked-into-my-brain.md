I'm letting this serve as a reminder - for you and for me.  While there's 
no revolutionary information here, it's all _incredibly_ important.  Often, the 
fundamentals are overlooked, so they're still worth writing down.

I started training Jiu-Jitsu regularly a little over a year ago.  I'd tried once 
years before and had a bad experience.  After being prodded by [Akash 
Thakkar](https://akashthakkar.com) a few times, I went on a whim and fell into 
_immediate_ addiction.

I'm absolutely one of those people who is obsessive over BJJ, thinks everyone 
should try it at least once (but really everyone should train), is completely 
overbearing about it, etc.  For me, it's because the sport truly rebuilt (or 
maybe built?) a part of me.  I consistently refer to it as "better therapy than 
therapy", and it consistently brings life lessons and reminders.

So, I'm going to consistently share those here.  This will not be the last 
Jiu-Jitsu related post, be forewarned.  For now, here's 3 critical work lessons 
the sport has, lovingly, "choked" into my brain.

# Being Uncomfortable is Temporary
- Jobs suck, even dream jobs
- When hard things occur, it's easy to get down and think you're stuck forever
- Even when the pain is immense, it's temporary
- Sometimes it's temporary because you build skill and find a way through
- Sometimes it's temporary because you simply endure
- Sometimes it's temporary because you escape
- Sometimes the pain is such that you need to take a break, too
- The biggest lesson is that you can handle it

# You Only Get Better Through Practice
- You think I'm talking about techncial skill building here, but I'm not
- Technical skill building is obvious "show up and design, code, etc."
- What isn't obvious is practice at soft skills
- Can you practice putting on a positive demeanor and team building?
- Can you encourage when things are hard?
- Have you clarified with your leadership what you can shore up in your work, 
  and ask them to help you find a way to ritualize practice?  (Yes, you can even 
  practice management and leadership!)
- The outcome of this practice doesn't matter.  It's _completely_ throwaway.  
  What matters is the reps and the consistency.  Building habits enforces 
  performance when it matters most.

# Progress is Non-Linear
- Everyone's had that first moment where you feel like you suck at your job, and 
  then you keep it up, and you stop sucking as much
- What's harder is when you're actually skilled, and you're pushing into new, 
  more difficult territory, and you feel like you suck again.
- They don't say it, but Directors and Leads feel the _most_ "impostor 
  syndrome".  They're also _not allowed_ to say that, as if they widely 
  broadcasted it, that would reduce trust (oddly, you can confess this in a 1:1 
  scenario and it engenders trust)
- Whether you're just starting out, or you've been at this for decades, the 
  lesson is still the same - progress is non-linear.  That means if you're 
  putting in a ton of effort and working hard and you feel like you're _more 
  terrible_ than you were before - that's a sign of likely progress (feel free 
  to confirm this with a 3rd party)
