- Good listening isn't about sound quality
	- Ironically, I've discovered that a majority of audio professionals are 
	  terrible listeners.

	- WHAT IS BAD LISTENING ? -
	- I don't mean that they don't hear well, can't mix, can't design, or craft 
	  absurdly high-quality content
	- I mean they where they succeed at the art of sound quality, they fail at 
	  the art of hearing others
	- The job of audio isn't to be "good at audio" - it's to communicate to the 
	  user.  If the sound is cool, but it fails to achieve the goal of the 
	  design, then the content has failed.
	- This presents the crux of the conundrum - what's the design intent?  If 
	  you know the design intent, does it make sense to you?  Does the design 
	  intent work within the context of the product?  Can you even make that, or 
	  fit it cleanly within the context?
	- The above is where we fail - we think we understand design intent, but we 
	  don't.  Or, we do, but we haul off to make something before we ask if we 
	  should.  Or, we know the design won't work, or it's dumb - but we don't 
	  want to say no or hurt someone's feelings.
	
	- HOW DO YOU LISTEN WELL? -
	- So how do you listen well?
	- Listening well involved two things: asking questions, and keeping your 
	  mouth shut
	- Ask what the design intent is.  When you think you understand it, 
	  reiterate your version if it back to the designer, and ask if you're 
	  correct.  Ask them if they've thought about the things you're concerned 
	  about that may not work.  If it's too big or grandiose, ask them if it's 
	  possible to achieve their goal with a smaller idea.
	- When they answer, -listen-, don't anticipate what you should say next or 
	  be afraid.  Collaboration is the back-and-forth sharing of ideas.  If this 
	  is in good faith, you should be able to respect each other.

	- WHY, IN THE LONG TERM, IS THIS IMPORTANT? -
	- Career building isn't solely about making a quality product.  Quality 
	  product is "table stakes", or, a baseline expectation.
	- People get more work, more promotions, etc if they're a "good hang".  
	  Those who are easy to work with, find themselves naturally solving 
	  problems and caring for others, as well as easily communicating and 
	  collaborating, often find themselves with plenty of opportunities.

	- WHAT IF IT ALL GOES HAYWIRE? -
	- Say no
